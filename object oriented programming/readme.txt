What is object oriented programming?

OOP is a programming paradigm which means it is a set of rules and ideas and concepts. It is basically a standard in programming that we use to solve a specific type of problem.

examples of other programming paradigm:
Imperative, Functional, Procedural, Declarative, etc.

+ Class
building block of oop
user defined data type (predefined data type [ int, float, etc ]  is the opposite of user defined)

	eg:- string username = ‘randomuser’
	eg:- class User -> name, age, email, weight, gender, etc

+ Objects

+ Access Modifiers

+ Constructor
constructor is a special type of method that is invoked each time that an object of a class is created.

------------------------------------------------
+ Encapsulation (bundling data)
bundling or tying together data and methods that operate on that data.
they are grouped together within a class
why we do this? the purpose of preventing anyone outside the class to be able to directly access our data and to interact with it and modify it.

i want to provide my own way for that happen.
so, how do i do that. well i provide very specific public functions

how do we access encapsulated properties of a class,
through its methods (getters and setters)

------------------------------------------------
+ Abstraction
Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details and complex things behind a procedure.

------------------------------------------------
+ Inheritance
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.

The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”.

1. Multilevel Inheritance
2. Multiple Inheritance

------------------------------------------------
+ Polymorphism and Virtual Function

poly - many
morph - forms

in programming it means the ability of an object or method to have many forms

------------------------------------------------
+ namespace
------------------------------------------------
+ streams and files

------------------------------------------------
+ Exception Handling
we use exceptions in order to handle different types of errors

try, catch & throw // keywords

we are going to simulate work of printer and let's see what are the potential issues and errors we will face and how to handle it using exceptions
